About OsmoBSC
=============

OsmoBSC originated from the OpenBSC project, which started as a minimalistic
all-in-one implementation of the GSM Network. In 2017, OpenBSC had reached
maturity and diversity (including M3UA SIGTRAN and 3G support in the form of
IuCS and IuPS interfaces) that naturally lead to a separation of the all-in-one
approach to fully independent separate programs as in typical GSM networks.

OsmoBSC was one of the parts split off from the old openbsc.git. Before, it
worked as a standalone osmo-bsc binary as well as a combination of libbsc and
libmsc, i.e. the old OsmoNITB. Since the standalone OsmoMSC with a true A
interface (and IuCS for 3G support) is available, OsmoBSC exists only as a
separate standalone entity.

OsmoBSC exposes
- A over IP towards an MSC (e.g. OsmoMSC);
- Abis interfaces towards various kinds of BTS;
- The Osmocom typical telnet VTY and CTRL interfaces.
